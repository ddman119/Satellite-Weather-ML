You can find the source files for the project located in the /code/ folder. 

In order to run you should have jupyter notebook installed on your system.

You will also need to download 30+GB of sattelite data image files from the following:

"kaggle competitions download -c planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space"

We have not included this into our repo, as the files are too big.

Also once data is downloaded, you must untar and unzip the compressed files containing the images. 

This process takes several hours.

We suggest not going this route, and on github using your browser, you can take a look at:


code/Amazon_Rainforest_Image_Classification.ipynb

code/CNN/notebook/notebook_VGG16.ipynb

These files once viewed in github on your default browser (ie. Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox/Safari) will show the outputs of our code.
